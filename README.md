I will provide a proper readme here in the future, but for the moment just the basics:
- To compile this yourself, you will want the latest version of wxWidgets and the g++ compiler
- There is a provided makefile for linux/unix, but for windows you will likely want to use VSCode
- I will be providing downloads for precompiled executables once I get the bugs worked out from the windows version
- The controls button currently does not do anything, but in the future I will have it pop out a small window to configure your controls before starting the seed
